# FIFO Buffer in Verilog

A basic 8-bit wide, 16-depth **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** buffer implemented in Verilog. Includes a testbench for simulation. Useful for learning digital design and memory queue concepts.

---

## Project Structure

- `fifo.v`: FIFO design file
- `fifo_tb.v`: Testbench for simulation

---

## Features

- 8-bit data width
- 16-depth FIFO buffer
- Synchronous design with full and empty flags

---

## How to simulate

Use any Verilog simulator (ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, Vivado, etc.) to compile and run the testbench.
